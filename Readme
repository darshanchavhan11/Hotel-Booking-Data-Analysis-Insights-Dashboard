Advanced Business Intelligence | Power BI | Data Cleaning | DAX | Insights & Strategy

📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking performance using advanced EDA, Power BI dashboarding, DAX measures, and business insights.

It aims to help hotel management:

Maximize revenue efficiency

Identify seasonal booking trends

Understand customer behavior

Improve guest retention

Reduce cancellation losses

Optimize room pricing strategy (ADR)

The dashboard transforms raw booking data into actionable insights that support real-time decision-making.


🧭 Objectives

✔ Identify trends in bookings, cancellations, and revenue
✔ Evaluate guest behavior (first-time vs repeat guests)
✔ Understand market segment contribution
✔ Forecast demand patterns
✔ Provide strategic recommendations for business growth

📂 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Understanding

Columns include: booking dates, ADR, market segment, guest counts, cancellation status, stay length, room category, revenue per stay, etc.

2️⃣ Data Cleaning (Excel)

Steps performed:

Removed duplicates

Standardized date formats

Treated missing values

Corrected inconsistent category names

Created new calculated fields (e.g., Revenue per Stay)

Converted text columns into categorical format

Ensured numerical fields were correctly typed

3️⃣ Data Modeling (Power BI)

Star schema-based fact table

Fact table → Bookings

Dimensions → Market Segment, Room Type, Meal, Guest Type

Relationships created using appropriate keys

Model optimized for fast DAX calculation performance


4️⃣ DAX Metrics (Core Measures)
🔹 Total Bookings
Total Bookings = COUNTROWS('Hotel Bookings (1)')

🔹 Total Revenue
Total_Revenue = SUM('Hotel Bookings (1)'[Revenue_per_Stay])

🔹 Average ADR
Average_ADR = AVERAGE('Hotel Bookings (1)'[ADR])

🔹 Repeat Guest Percentage
Repeat_Guest_Percentage =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS('Hotel Bookings (1)'), 
        'Hotel Bookings (1)'[is_repeated_guest] = 1
    ),
    [Total Bookings]
)

🔹 Total Guests
Total_Guests = SUM('Hotel Bookings (1)'[Total_Guest])
